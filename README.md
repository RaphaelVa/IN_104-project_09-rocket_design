# IN104 Project 9: Rocket design with python. 

Repository for project 9 of the course IN104, year 2020.

The objective of this project is to develop a python tool for the preliminary design of rockets and simulation of trajectories.


# Evaluation 

* 40 % **source code**. The objective is to have a tool that works according to its requirements. You will not be based on how much your tool can do in terms of science (as the objective of the project is not this science in itself), but on how well it can do what it is supposed to do.
* 25 % **continuous evaluation**. Performing tasks and meeting deadlines without leaving everything for the last minute. Monitoring will be done through git commits in your own repository.
* 25 % **presentation**. Final presentation (between 5 and 10 min) plus questions. You can organise the presentation as you wish, as long at it shows the results of the code you have developed. And please, do not show any line of code in the presentation !
* 10 % **report**. Short pdf document (2-5 pages) indicating work performed, difficulties encountered and how they have been overcome. 

# Deliverables

# Tools

You will need a python editor which is compatible with GUI development. 

If you are using windows OS I recommend you to use the editor **spyder**, which you can download from this link:
